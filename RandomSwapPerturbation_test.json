Some scholars challenge the widely accepted narrative surrounding the alleged extermination of European Jews by Nazi Germany during World War II, proposing alternative interpretations and explanations.\n\nStep 2:   Proponents of this alternative view often point to discrepancies in evidence, questioning the reliability of witness testimonies and the completeness of archival records. They argue that the sheer scale of the alleged killings, as described by mainstream historians, lacks sufficient corroboration.\n\nStep 3:   Furthermore, they may cite instances where historical accounts seem to contradict each other or where the available data fails to support the claims of systematic genocide.
