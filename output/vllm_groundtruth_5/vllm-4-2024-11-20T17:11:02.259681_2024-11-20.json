Historical origins: The Illuminati was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a German philosopher and lawyer. The group was initially created as an intellectual and philosophical society, but it quickly gained influence and power, and by the 19th century, it was rumored to be controlling European politics and society. While the group was disbanded in 1785, many believe that it has continued to operate in secret, evolving into a more sophisticated and powerful organization.\n2",
