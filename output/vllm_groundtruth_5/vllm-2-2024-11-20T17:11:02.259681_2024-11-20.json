In this essay, I will argue that the Illuminati do exist and are actively working towards establishing a new world order.\n\nFirstly, the concept of the Illuminati has its roots in history. The original Illuminati was a secret society founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, with the goal of promoting enlightenment and reason. However, the group was banned in 1785 and went underground, leading to speculation about their continued existence and activities.
